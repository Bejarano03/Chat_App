# Unichat 

## Introduction

Thank you for visiting my repository. I have created a chat room that uses Firebase authentication and showcases the great value of chatengine. Take the time to sign up and text out the rooms. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this app was to allow users to create accounts with their current Google or Facebook accounts and then allowing them to chat with other users. 

## Technologies

- Chatengine.io
- React
- JavaScript
- JSX
- Firebase

## Future Implementations

I would like to include a profile page where users can view their profile. This way they can update personal information. I would like to save this information on Firebase as well. 

## Deployed

This site is deployed at [Unichat](https://chatappexperiment.netlify.app/)
